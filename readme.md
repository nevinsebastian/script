# Sample Data Analysis with Plotly and Pandas

This Python script analyzes sample data from an Excel file using Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for data visualization. The script reads the data from an Excel file named `test_with cell_13.02.24.pcus 1 hour_exported_S0_C1.xlsx`.

## Installation

### 1. Install Python

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH during installation.

### 2. Install Dependencies

You need to install the required Python packages. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly
```

This command installs the necessary packages:

- Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library.
- Plotly: An interactive plotting library.

### 3. Clone the Repository

download the Python script to your local machine.


```

### 4. Run the Script

1. Place the Excel file `test_with cell_13.02.24.pcus 1 hour_exported_S0_C1.xlsx` in the same directory as the script.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
3. Run the Python script using the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py
```



## Description

- The script imports Pandas as `pd` and Plotly's graph objects as `go`.
- Numeric data is extracted from the DataFrame and stored in `data_numeric`.
- Maximum and minimum amplitudes are calculated from the numeric data.
- Plotly traces for maximum and minimum amplitudes are created.
- A Plotly figure is generated with the traces and customized layout.
- The x-axis tick labels are replaced with alphabet labels using the `get_alphabet_labels()` function.
- The resulting plot is displayed using `fig.show()`.

## Output

The script generates a Plotly figure displaying the maximum and minimum amplitudes against the sample data. The x-Feel free to adjust this README as needed, and let me know if you require any further modifications!axis labels are  alphabet labels for better visualization.
